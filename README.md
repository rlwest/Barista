# Barista
Group project to model a coffee shop called the Lofi Cafe
## Folders
* Markdown folder
  * This folder contains the Barista Expertise SGOMS model 
  * It uses Markdown to create pseudo SGOMS code
    * https://guides.github.com/features/mastering-markdown/
* Python 3 version folder
  * This is the Python3 ACT-R model of the Lofi Cafe
  * This is where the simulations happen
* Stepper folder
   * This was an idea for a viewer that could navigate the Markdown Pseudo Code
      * as if one were a barista in the Lofi Cafe
* Interuptions should probably not be a folder
